# Predict Clicked Ads Customer Classification by using Machine Learning: Overview of the Project
- The dataset is obtained from Rakamin Academy.

1. Problem Statement: Currently, only about 50% of the total ads displayed on the company's platform are clicked by customers. The company aims to improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by displaying ads only to customers who have previously clicked on ads. The objective is to measure the extent to which their marketing campaigns reach customers and capture their attention to view the ads.
2. Goal: Increase the click-through rate (CTR) of ads by customers from 50% to 98%.
3. Objective: Build a machine learning classification model that can identify the right target customers. 
> A more specific objective is to create a machine learning model that predicts the probability that a customer will click on an ad based on their historical data.
4. Business Metric: Click-Through Rate (CTR)
